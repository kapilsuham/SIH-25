# AI-powered FRA Atlas & WebGIS-based Decision Support System (DSS)


A comprehensive platform to digitize, analyze, and visualize Forest Rights Act (FRA) implementation data. It leverages AI, Satellite Imagery, and WebGIS to track claims and recommend government schemes for tribal and forest-dwelling communities.

## üöÄ Features

- **Interactive WebGIS Atlas:** Visualize FRA claims on an interactive map with filtering and analysis tools.
- **AI-Powered Land Analysis:** Uses a U-Net model to analyze satellite imagery and identify land types from FRA claim parcels.
- **Scheme Recommendation Engine:** An ML model (XGBoost) that recommends eligible government welfare schemes based on community profiles.
- **Real-time Monitoring Dashboard:** Track the status of claims and implementation metrics across states.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Leaflet, Axios, Recharts
- **Backend:** FastAPI, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, SQLAlchemy, GeoAlchemy2
- **AI/ML:** TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, OpenCV
- **Deployment:** Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx
